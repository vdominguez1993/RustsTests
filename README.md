# RustsTests
Tests done to learn Rust.

The aim of these tests is to build a Rust HTTP server
to run in a Raspberry Pi to read some temperatures.

## Rust coding 
### Install Rust

Check oficial documentation [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Building

The build will be managed with cargo. To build, just call ``cargo build``.

## Why am I writting my own HTTP server
My aim is to learn Rust so, why not? I know it will have a lot of flaws
and security issues, but the aim of the project is to be run in a local and domestic environment.

For the moment it's fine for me.
